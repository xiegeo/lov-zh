# THE TWO SISTERS 二姐妹

THE LIONS 双狮峰

You can see them as you look towards the north and the west, where
the dream-hills swim into the sky amid their ever-drifting clouds
of pearl and grey.  They catch the earliest hint of sunrise, they
hold the last color of sunset.  Twin mountains they are, lifting
their twin peaks above the fairest city in all Canada, and known
throughout the British Empire as "The Lions of Vancouver."  
当你在城市里往北偏西张望时，会看到梦幻般的山丘游入了天空，漂移着珍珠色和灰色的云。它们抓住了日出时最早的来讯，它们挽留了日落时最后的色彩。它们就是一对双山，在加拿大最美丽的城市上空立起双峰。它们就是大英帝国众所周知的“温哥华双狮峰”。

Sometimes the smoke of forest fires blurs them until they gleam like
opals in a purple atmosphere, too beautiful for words to paint.
Sometimes the slanting rains festoon scarfs of mist about their
crests, and the peaks fade into shadowy outlines, melting, melting,
forever melting into the distances.   
有时，它们被森林大火的烟雾笼罩，逐渐模糊，直到它们在紫色的大气中像蛋白石一样闪闪发光，美丽的不能用语言描述。
有时，倾斜的雨水给山顶花彩上了薄雾头巾，让双峰渐渐的只剩下阴暗的轮廓，融化，融化，融化到了遥远的天边。  
But for most days in the year
the sun circles the twin glories with a sweep of gold.  The moon
washes them with a torrent of silver.  
但是在每年的大多数日子里， 太阳是以一笔金粉围绕双峰辉煌。月亮则用一股银水清洗它们。  
Oftentimes, when the city is
shrouded in rain, the sun yellows their snows to a deep orange; but
through sun and shadow they stand immovable, smiling westward above
the waters of the restless Pacific, eastward above the superb beauty
of the Capilano Canyon.  
经常，当这个城市被笼罩在雨中时，山上的雪被太阳照成深橙色；然而它们在光影下还能一丝不动的微笑，向着西方太平洋焦急的海面上，又向着东方卡皮拉诺峡谷绝美的大地上。  
But the Indian tribes do not know these
peaks as "The Lions."  Even the chief, whose feet have so recently
wandered to the Happy Hunting Grounds, never heard the name given
them until I mentioned it to him one dreamy August day, as together
we followed the trail leading to the canyon.  
但是印第安部落并不吧它们称作“双狮峰”。即使是酋长，他的双脚刚刚游入了狩猎乐土，也从来没有听说过这个名字，直到我在一个梦幻般的八月天跟他在一个通往峡谷的小道上提了起来。  
He seemed so surprised
at the name that I mentioned the reason it had been applied to them,
asking him if he recalled the Landseer Lions in Trafalgar Square.  
他对这个名字感到很惊讶，我就说出了它的来源，问他是否记得特拉法加广场上的兰西尔狮子。  
Yes, he remembered those splendid sculptures, and his quick eye saw
the resemblance instantly.  
是的，他记得那些雄伟的雕塑，他的锐眼瞬间看到了相似之处。  
It appeared to please him, and his fine
face expressed the haunting memories of the far-away roar of Old
London.  
这似乎取悦他，他的俊脸透露出了难忘的记忆，那是遥远的旧伦敦之吼。  
But the "call of the blood" was stronger, and presently he
referred to the Indian legend of those peaks--a legend that I have
reason to believe is absolutely unknown to thousands of Palefaces
who look upon "The Lions" daily, without the love for them that is
in the Indian heart, without knowledge of the secret of "The Two
Sisters."  
但是“血的呼唤”更强烈，现在他开始讲述那些山峰的印第安传说 -- 一个我有理由相信是不被那上千个每天都看着“狮子峰”的白人所知的故事。他们没有一颗像印第安人一样那么爱它们的心，因为他们不懂得“二姐妹”的秘密。  
The legend was intensely fascinating as it left his lips
in the quaint broken English that is never so dulcet as when it
slips from an Indian tongue.  His inimitable gestures, strong,
graceful, comprehensive, were like a perfectly chosen frame
embracing a delicate painting, and his brooding eyes were as the
light in which the picture hung.  
这个传说让他讲的非常引人入胜。他讲的英语离奇破碎，只从印第安人口中才能听到如此悦耳的声音。他独特的姿态，强壮，优雅，全面，就像是有一个完美挑选出的画框拥抱住一幅精致的画作，又被他那忧郁的眼光照着。  
"Many thousands of years ago,"
he began, "there were no twin peaks like sentinels guarding the
outposts of this sunset coast.  They were placed there long after
the first creation, when the Sagalie Tyee moulded the mountains,
and patterned the mighty rivers where the salmon run, because
of His love for His Indian children, and His wisdom for their
necessities.  
“几千年以前，”他开始说：“这里没有像哨兵一样守护这个夕阳海岸的双峰。它们是创始之后，过了很久很久才被安置在那里的。神（Sagalie Tyee）塑造了山脉，描述了大江，让三文鱼回游，因为他热爱着他的印第安孩子们，他也深知他们生活的基本需求。  
In those times there were many and mighty Indian
tribes along the Pacific--in the mountain ranges, at the shores
and sources of the great Fraser River.  Indian law ruled the land.
Indian customs prevailed.  Indian beliefs were regarded.  Those
were the legend-making ages when great things occurred to make the
traditions we repeat to our children to-day.  
在那个时代，太平洋沿岸上有许多强大的印第安部落。他们栖息在山脉中。他们栖息在浩大的菲沙河岸跟源头。印第安法律统治了这片土地。印第安习俗占据了社会主流。印第安信仰被受尊重。那是一个塑造传奇的时代，当时发生的伟大事情造就了我们今日代代讲给孩子们听的传统。  
Perhaps the greatest
of these traditions is the story of 'The Two Sisters,' for they
are known to us as 'The Chief's Daughters,' and to them we owe the
Great Peace in which we live, and have lived for many countless
moons.  
在这些故事中，也许最伟大的传说要数‘二姐妹’了。我们吧她们称作‘酋长的女儿们’。我们要为这无数星月里的长久和平为她们感恩。  
There is an ancient custom amongst the coast tribes that,
when our daughters step from childhood into the great world of
womanhood, the occasion must be made one of extreme rejoicing.  
在海岸部落中有一种古老的习俗，当我们的女儿从童年步入到伟大的女性世界时，这是一个极其值得庆祝的日子。  
The being who possesses the possibility of some day mothering a
man-child, a warrior, a brave, receives much consideration in most
nations; but to us, the Sunset tribes, she is honored above all
people.  
因为她有生育培养一个男孩，一个战士，一个英雄的可能性，所以大部分国家都会对她关心；但是对于我们日落部落（指海岸部落的一个分支，或者两词同义）来说，她是所有人里最值得尊重的。  
The parents usually give a great potlatch, and a feast
that lasts many days.  The entire tribe and the surrounding tribes
are bidden to this festival.  
通常，父母会举办一个豪华的散财宴（potlatch）和多日的盛宴。整个部落和周围的部落都被邀请。  
More than that, sometimes when a
great Tyee celebrates for his daughter, the tribes from far up the
coast, from the distant north, from inland, from the island, from
the Cariboo country, are gathered as guests to the feast.  
不止于此，有时当一个伟大的酋长为他的女儿庆祝时，从海岸远处，遥远的北方，内陆，岛屿，和卡里布地区的部落都会来庆祝。  
During
these days of rejoicing the girl is placed in a high seat, an
exalted position, for is she not marriageable?  And does not
marriage mean motherhood?  And does not motherhood mean a vaster
nation of brave sons and of gentle daughters, who, in their turn,
will give us sons and daughters of their own?  
在这些欢庆的日子里，女孩被安置在一个高坐上，那是一个崇高的位置，因为她不适合婚姻吗？结婚不意为母亲？母亲不意为我们民族添加了勇敢的儿子和温柔的女儿，再代代相传？”

"But it was many thousands of years ago that a great Tyee had two
daughters that grew to womanhood at the same springtime, when the
first great run of salmon thronged the rivers, and the ollallie
bushes were heavy with blossoms.  These two daughters were young,
lovable, and oh! very beautiful.  Their father, the great Tyee,
prepared to make a feast such as the Coast had never seen.  There
were to be days and days of rejoicing, the people were to come for
many leagues, were to bring gifts to the girls and to receive gifts
of great value from the chief, and hospitality was to reign as long
as pleasuring feet could dance, and enjoying lips could laugh, and
mouths partake of the excellence of the chief's fish, game, and
ollallies.  
“但是在几千年前，在一个三文鱼刚开始回游并挤满了河流，莓果丛中百花齐放的春天，一位大酋长的两个女儿同时成年。她们年轻，可爱，哦！太漂亮了！她们的父亲，伟大的酋长，准备了一个海岸上从未见过的盛宴。

"The only shadow on the joy of it all was war, for the tribe of the
great Tyee was at war with the Upper Coast Indians, those who lived
north, near what is named by the Paleface as the port of Prince
Rupert.  Giant war-canoes slipped along the entire coast, war
parties paddled up and down, war-songs broke the silences of the
nights, hatred, vengeance, strife, horror festered everywhere like
sores on the surface of the earth.  But the great Tyee, after
warring for weeks, turned and laughed at the battle and the
bloodshed, for he had been victor in every encounter, and he could
well afford to leave the strife for a brief week and feast in his
daughters' honor, nor permit any mere enemy to come between him and
the traditions of his race and household.  So he turned insultingly
deaf ears to their war-cries; he ignored with arrogant indifference
their paddle-dips that encroached within his own coast waters, and
he prepared, as a great Tyee should, to royally entertain his
tribesmen in honor of his daughters.

"But seven suns before the great feast these two maidens came before
him, hand clasped in hand.

"'Oh! our father,' they said, 'may we speak?'

"'Speak, my daughters, my girls with the eyes of April, the hearts
of June'" (early spring and early summer would be the more accurate
Indian phrasing).

"'Some day, oh! our father, we may mother a man-child, who may grow
to be just such a powerful Tyee as you are, and for this honor that
may some day be ours we have come to crave a favor of you--you, Oh!
our father.'

"'It is your privilege at this celebration to receive any favor your
hearts may wish,' he replied graciously, placing his fingers beneath
their girlish chins.  'The favor is yours before you ask it, my
daughters.'

"'Will you, for our sakes, invite the great northern hostile
tribe--the tribe you war upon--to this, our feast?' they asked
fearlessly.

"'To a peaceful feast, a feast in the honor of women?' he exclaimed
incredulously.

"'So we would desire it,' they answered.

"'And so shall it be,' he declared.  'I can deny you nothing this
day, and some time you may bear sons to bless this peace you have
asked, and to bless their mother's sire for granting it.'  Then he
turned to all the young men of the tribe and commanded: 'Build fires
at sunset on all the coast headlands--fires of welcome.  Man your
canoes and face the north, greet the enemy, and tell them that I,
the Tyee of the Capilanos, ask--no, command--that they join me for a
great feast in honor of my two daughters.'  And when the northern
tribes got this invitation they flocked down the coast to this feast
of a Great Peace.  They brought their women and their children;
they brought game and fish, gold and white stone beads, baskets and
carven ladles, and wonderful woven blankets to lay at the feet of
their now acknowledged ruler, the great Tyee.  And he, in turn, gave
such a potlatch that nothing but tradition can vie with it.  There
were long, glad days of joyousness, long, pleasurable nights of
dancing and camp-fires, and vast quantities of food.  The war-canoes
were emptied of their deadly weapons and filled with the daily catch
of salmon.  The hostile war-songs ceased, and in their place were
heard the soft shuffle of dancing feet, the singing voices of women,
the play-games of the children of two powerful tribes which had been
until now ancient enemies, for a great and lasting brotherhood was
sealed between them--their war-songs were ended forever.

"Then the Sagalie Tyee smiled on His Indian children: 'I will
make these young-eyed maidens immortal,' He said.  In the cup of
His hands He lifted the chief's two daughters and set them forever
in a high place, for they had borne two offspring--Peace and
Brotherhood--each of which is now a great Tyee ruling this land.

"And on the mountain crest the chief's daughters can be seen wrapped
in the suns, the snows, the stars of all seasons, for they have
stood in this high place for thousands of years, and will stand for
thousands of years to come, guarding the peace of the Pacific Coast
and the quiet of the Capilano Canyon."

This is the Indian legend of "The Lions of Vancouver" as I had it
from one who will tell me no more the traditions of his people.
